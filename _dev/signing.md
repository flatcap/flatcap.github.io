If you're planning to build your own version of NeoMutt, it's important to
check that the source hasn't been tampered with.

All **release commits** in Git are signed and all **GitHub downloads** come
with a SHA256 CHECKSUM file.

## Keys

The NeoMutt signing key is:

- `86C2397270DD7A561263CA4E5FAF0A6EE7371805`
- Richard Russon (NeoMutt) <rich@flatcap.org>

This key is available on keyservers:

```sh
gpg2 --search-keys neomutt
```

```reply
gpg: data source: http://c-73-164-0-249.hsd1.mn.comcast.net:11371
(1)	Richard Russon (NeoMutt) <rich@flatcap.org>
	  4096 bit RSA key 5FAF0A6EE7371805, created: 2016-04-08, expires: 2019-04-13
Keys 1-1 of 1 for "neomutt".  Enter number(s), N)ext, or Q)uit >
```

## Git example

**Note**: On the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/releases), **all**
releases should display a "Verified" tag. This confirms that the release
matches the NeoMutt signing key.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt
cd neomutt
git
git tag -v neomutt-20170428
```
