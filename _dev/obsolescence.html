<p>The state, process, or condition of being or becoming out of date</p>

<h2>Searching</h2>

<p>
  If you search for "mutt" on GitHub, Bitbucket, etc. you will find &gt;700
  repositories. There are a lot of people who thought that Mutt needed
  something extra.
</p>

<p>
  Most of the repos contain the same features, e.g. Sidebar, Index Color.
  Unfortunately, each repo was created at a different time with a different
  version of the patch and occasionally different bug fixes.
</p>

<p>
  Richard Russon <a href="https://github.com/flatcap">(FlatCap)</a> examined
  all these repos and determined what should be preserved. The results are
  saved in the <a href="https://github.com/neomutt/community">community repo</a>.
</p>

<h2>Making releases</h2>

<p>
  Searching and categorising these repos took a lot of time. It means that when
  a NeoMutt release is made, we can categorically say: "This is the only
  version you'll need".
</p>

<p>
  Alternatively, "This NeoMutt version obsoletes this list of versions".
</p>
