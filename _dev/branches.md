| [neomutt](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/tree/master)        | Main branch -- The Official NeoMutt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Branch         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| devel/{NAME}   | New features are created in `devel` branches. When complete, documented and tested they are merged into the `master` branch.                                                                                                                                                  |
| distro/{NAME}  | We keep reference copies of some of the downstream distros' NeoMutt code. **Note:** some of these repos are out-of-date.                                                                                                                                                      |
| issue/{NUMBER} | When fixing a bug, sometimes we create an `issue` branch for the user to test.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| travis         | Code sent to [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/neomutt/neomutt) for testing. Travis can't be run automatically on the `master` branch, because we have about 30 different options. Travis limits the amout of builds per week, so we are forced to do that in an extra branch. |
| coverity       | Code sent to [Coverity](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/neomutt-neomutt) for testing. Coverity limits the weekly builds like Travis, so we have to do that in an external branch.                                                                                          |
