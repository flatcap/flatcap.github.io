## How does it work?

The NeoMutt program is written in English, but it has been through a process of
Internationalization and Localization.

**Internationalization** (abbreviated to **i18n**):

- is changing the source code of a program to allow it to look up strings that
  need translation
- [is done by programmers](/dev/translate-code)

**Localization** (abbreviated to **l10n**):

- is providing a list of translated strings for a language
- is done by translators
- does not require programming skills

The translation team is currently managed by
[Rich Russon (flatcap)](mailto:rich@flatcap.org).

It would be a great help to the project (and Rich) if someone volunteered to
help with this.

## State of the translations

NeoMutt builds upon Mutt, so it has inherited its translations. Mutt hasn't
changed much (in years), [so most of them are still correct](/translate.html).

Here are some recent statistics for the Swedish translation:

| Count  | Description                              |
| -----: | :--------------------------------------- |
|   1321 | Total number of strings to be translated |
|    998 | Already translated                       |
|    219 | Fuzzy -- need checking by a human        |
|    104 | To do -- need translating                |

The "fuzzy" translations appear when the `msgfmt` tool finds a translation that
it thinks is correct. These translations are often wrong.

## Is the job technical?

No, it's quite simple -- you just need to be multi-lingual.

The translations are stored in "Portable Object" text files (.po)

Here's a sample from the Japanese translation (ja.po)

```
#: main.c:905
msgid "Mailbox is empty."
msgstr "メールボックスが空。"
```

- A comment, starting with a `#`
- "msgid" -- the string in English
- "msgstr" -- the string in Japanese

There are plenty of tools to help you with the translation process. One of
them is "poedit" -- it's quite simple to use. This screenshot shows some
translated, some fuzzy and some untranslated strings.

**Notes**:

- **Comments**: "poedit" allows you to add comments to each translation. If you
  think that the comment should apply to **all** translations, then notify the
  NeoMutt project and they can add the comment to the source.
- **Context**: The strings are sometimes hard to translate because they have no
  context. If you have any questions, ask the translations manager (at the top
  of the page).

## More information

The translation mechanism uses GNU's "gettext". Here are some of the relevant
parts of their docs:

- [Internationalization and Localization](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Concepts)
- [Format of PO Files](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#PO-Files)
- [printf(1) strings](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#c_002dformat-Flag)

If you're technical you could look at the NeoMutt source code:

```
git clone -b translate https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt
```

## Sharing your work

NeoMutt has new releases about once a month. Before each release, the
translators will be emailed and asked for their latest `.po` file. This will
be merged into NeoMutt and an updated copy will be mailed back.
