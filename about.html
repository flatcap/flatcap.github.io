<h2>What is NeoMutt?</h2>

<p>
  <b>NeoMutt</b> is a command line <b>mail reader</b> based on Mutt.<br>
  It's versatile and highly configurable.
</p>

<p>
  It has lots of <a href="feature.html">new features</a> which come with
  documentation and sample config files.
</p>

<p>
  The sidebar on the left shows the folders; the index panel on the right shows the emails.<br>
  Almost every feature of the display can be configured, e.g. the visibility,
  size, colour and content of the sidebar. The layout, colour and formatting of
  the index panel.

<h2>What is NeoMutt (the project)?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>NeoMutt is a project of projects.</li>
  <li>A place to gather all the patches against Mutt.</li>
  <li>A place for all the developers to gather.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Hopefully this will build the community and reduce duplicated effort.
</p>

<h3>Why call it NeoMutt?</h3>

<p>
  NeoMutt is just a name. When <a href="https://github.com/flatcap">FlatCap</a>
  created the project, he needed a name that was unused on GitHub.
</p>

<h3>Is it a Fork?</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>It's <b>not a fork</b> of Mutt.</dt>
  <dd>We merge all of Mutt's changes into NeoMutt and get features into a state
  that Mutt will accept.</dd>

  <dt>It's a large set of feature patches</dt>
  <dd>There are over twenty patches, big and small, that apply to Mutt-1.8.0.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Reduce duplication</li>
  <li>Get patches in a state to be accepted upstream</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Many hundreds of Mutt users have taken the time to patch Mutt to add features.
  Unfortunately, it's usually the same patches as everyone else and effort is
  wasted.
</p>

<p>
  Also, there are some heroic developers who have been maintaining multi-thousand
  line patches:
  <ul>
    <li>Notmuch patch &gt;4 years</li>
    <li>Sidebar patch &gt;10 years &ndash; <b>Now accepted upstream</b></li>
    <li>NNTP patch &gt;15 years</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>What's been done so far?</h2>

<h3>Additions to Mutt</h3>

<p>
  <a href="/feature/sidebar">Sidebar</a> has been completely overhauled,
  merging features, fixing bugs, tidying code and documenting the results.
</p>

<p>
  Sidebar is our first success story. The patch was accepted upstream and
  released in Mutt-1.7.0.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="/feature/notmuch">Notmuch</a> has been brought up-to-date, against
  Mutt-1.8.0. It has been split out of the
  <a href="https://github.com/karelzak/mutt-kz">mutt-kz repo</a> and refactored
  slightly.
</p>

<p>
  19 other <a href="/feature.html">Features</a> have been tidied and documented.
</p>

<h2>What's next?</h2>

<p>
  NeoMutt now has all the big features that existed as patches. It's stable
  and up-to-date with Mutt. So, what next?
</p>

<p>
  Below is a list of areas we'd like to work on:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Features / Enhancements</dt>
  <dd>There are a few more large features that we can incorporate and users ask
    for smaller enhancements almost daily.</dd>

  <dt>Bug-Fixes</dt>
  <dd>The more users there are of NeoMutt, the more bugs they find. That's
    good though. We're doing very well finding and fixing bugs.</dd>

  <dt>Mentoring</dt>
  <dd>If we break down some of our development problems into smaller, more
    manageable tasks, we can encourage new developers to take an active part,
    learning in the process.</dd>

  <dt>Better Sidebar integration</dt>
  <dd>
    <a href="/feature/notmuch">Notmuch</a> and
    <a href="/feature/nntp">NNTP</a> would really benefit from closer
    <a href="/feature/sidebar">Sidebar</a> integration.</dd>

  <dt>Unifying distros</dt>
  <dd>Many of the distros' feature patches have already been integrated into NeoMutt.
    Each patch NeoMutt adopts brings all the distros closer together, reducing
    their workload.</dd>

  <dt>Better Colour Support</dt>
  <dd>
    NeoMutt has added
    <a href="/feature/status-color">Status-Color</a> and
    <a href="/feature/index-color">Index-Color</a> patches.
    They work, but fall short of what's needed.
  </dd>

  <dt>Scripting</dt>
  <dd>
    NeoMutt could be so much more powerful if it had scripting capability.
    A possible candidate is <a href="https://www.lua.org/">LUA</a>, which is
    small, simple, but powerful.
  </dd>

  <dt>Upstream</dt>
  <dd>Get more features accepted into upstream Mutt</dd>
</dl>
