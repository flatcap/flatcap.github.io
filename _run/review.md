When feedback is needed

## Overview

**Important points:**

* We don't want people to waste their time, either
  * writing code we don't want
  * duplicating the work of others

**For most new work some discussion is needed first.**

* What do you want to change?
* Why is that needed?
* What's the best way to do it?

**You can get approval from:**

* [IRC #neomutt][irc]
* [Issue][issues]
* [Mailing list][maillist]

**Who gives approval?**

* Project reviewers (team on GitHub)
  - Richard Russon (@flatcap)
  - Darshit Shah (@darnir)
  - Guillaume Brogi (@guiniol)
  - Pierre-Elliott BÃ©cue (@p-eb)
  - Bernard Pratz (@guyzmo)
  - Damien Riegel (@d-k-c)
  - Pietro Cerutti (@gahr)

**Don't need approval for:**

* Fixing bugs (assign yourself before you start)
* Altering documentation
* Adding to the website
* Adding comment blocks
* Updating translations

**Feedback:**

* We want to know what's going on, so we can plan releases
* People need a little freedom to experiment before others express their
  opinions

**When does a user want:**

* Feedback?
* Review?
* Merge?
