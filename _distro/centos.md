The NeoMutt RPMs are published in a YUM repo. This is a public repository run
by Richard Russon ([FlatCap](https://github.com/flatcap)) <[rich@flatcap.org](mailto:rich@flatcap.org)>

They provide NeoMutt for both CentOS and RedHat Enterprise Linux.

## Installation <a class="offset" id="install"></a>

The instructions work for all versions of CentOS / RHEL. The commands should
be run as root, or prefixed with `sudo`.

First download the repo file for your OS:

- CentOS / RHEL v6
  [flatcap-neomutt-epel-6.repo](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/flatcap/neomutt/repo/epel-6/flatcap-neomutt-epel-6.repo)
- CentOS / RHEL v7
  [flatcap-neomutt-epel-7.repo](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/flatcap/neomutt/repo/epel-7/flatcap-neomutt-epel-7.repo)

Now, copy it into place and install:

```
cp flatcap-neomutt-epel-7.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/
yum install neomutt
```

You will see a warning, which you can say 'y' to.

## Update <a class="offset" id="update"></a>

Once NeoMutt is installed, it will be updated automatically when you perform
system updates. You can make that happen sooner by running:

```
yum update
```

## Removal <a class="offset" id="remove"></a>

To completely remove NeoMutt from your system:

```
yum remove neomutt
rm -f /etc/yum.repos.d/flatcap-neomutt-epel-*.repo
```

If, instead, you would like to downgrade to Mutt:

```
yum remove neomutt
rm -f /etc/yum.repos.d/flatcap-neomutt-epel-*.repo
yum install mutt
```

## Building from source <a class="offset" id="build"></a>

These instructions will help you install all the dependencies you'll need to
build NeoMutt from the source code.

1. The best way to get the latest source code is to use `git`.
2. Minimum tools you need to build NeoMutt
3. Generate the documentation
4. Advanced features of NeoMutt
5. Local caching of emails

```
yum install git
yum install autoconf automake gcc gettext-devel ncurses-devel slang-devel
yum install docbook-dtds docbook-style-xsl libxslt lynx
yum install cyrus-sasl-devel gnutls-devel gpgme-devel krb5-devel
yum install tokyocabinet-devel
```

Unfortunately, these libraries aren't available in CentOS / RHEL:

- notmuch-devel
- kyotocabinet-devel
- lmdb-devel

Now you can follow the [guide for building NeoMutt](/dev/build).

## Debugging <a class="offset" id="debug"></a>

These instructions will help you install all the dependencies you'll need to
debug NeoMutt.

```
yum install gdb yum-utils
debuginfo-install bzip2-libs cyrus-sasl-lib glibc gnutls gpgme libassuan libgcrypt
debuginfo-install libgpg-error libtasn1 ncurses-libs nss-softokn-freebl tokyocabinet zlib
```

Now you can follow the [guide for debugging NeoMutt](/dev/debug).
