The NeoMutt RPMs are published in a COPR. This is a public repository run by
Richard Russon ([FlatCap](https://github.com/flatcap)) <[rich@flatcap.org](mailto:rich@flatcap.org)>

## Installation <a class="offset" id="install"></a>

The instructions work for all versions of Fedora. The commands should be run
as root, or prefixed with `sudo`.

"dnf-plugins-core" will probably already be installed.

```
dnf install dnf-plugins-core
```

```reply
Package dnf-plugins-core.noarch is already installed, skipping.
Dependencies resolved.
Nothing to do.
Complete!
```

Next, enable the NeoMutt COPR:

```
dnf copr enable flatcap/neomutt
```

You will be shown a warning, which you need to say **yes** to:

```reply
You are about to enable a Copr repository. Please note that this
repository is not part of the main Fedora distribution, and quality
may vary.

The Fedora Project does not exercise any power over the contents of
this repository beyond the rules outlined in the Copr FAQ at
<https://fedorahosted.org/copr/wiki/UserDocs#WhatIcanbuildinCopr>, and
packages are not held to any quality or security level.

Please do not file bug reports about these packages in Fedora
Bugzilla. In case of problems, contact the owner of this repository.

Do you want to continue? [y/N]:
```

Finally, install the NeoMutt package:

```
dnf install neomutt
```

During the installation, dnf will ask you to verify the public key of the
package. Check that fingerprint **exactly** matches the one shown below, then
say **yes**. This step only has to be done once -- for the first install.

```reply
Importing GPG key 0xFACB00B1:
 Userid     : "flatcap_NeoMutt (None) <flatcap#NeoMutt@copr.fedorahosted.org>"
 Fingerprint: 654D 24A3 6315 9304 787B 8F9B FC43 0E26 FACB 00B1
 From       : https://copr-be.cloud.fedoraproject.org/results/flatcap/neomutt/pubkey.gpg
Is this ok [y/N]:
```

## Alternative install <a class="offset" id="alternate"></a>

An alternative way to install NeoMutt is to download the rpm directly from the
server (and verify it using the
 [public key](https://copr-be.cloud.fedoraproject.org/results/flatcap/neomutt/pubkey.gpg)).

[https://copr-be.cloud.fedoraproject.org/results/flatcap/neomutt/](https://copr-be.cloud.fedoraproject.org/results/flatcap/neomutt/)

```
gpg2 --with-fingerprint pubkey.gpg
```

```reply
pub   rsa2048 2016-04-10 [SCEA] [expires: 2021-04-09]
      654D 24A3 6315 9304 787B  8F9B FC43 0E26 FACB 00B1
uid           flatcap_NeoMutt (None) <flatcap#NeoMutt@copr.fedorahosted.org>
```

## Update <a class="offset" id="update"></a>

Once NeoMutt is installed, it will be updated automatically when you perform
system updates. You can make that happen sooner by running:

```
dnf update
```

## Removal <a class="offset" id="remove"></a>

To completely remove NeoMutt from your system:

```
dnf remove neomutt
dnf copr remove flatcap/neomutt
```

```reply
Repository successfully removed.
```

If, instead, you would like to downgrade to Mutt:

```
dnf install --allowerasing mutt
```

```reply

2. Minimum tools you need to build NeoMutt
3. Generate the documentation
4. Advanced features of NeoMutt
5. Local caching of emails

```
dnf install git
dnf install autoconf automake gcc ncurses-devel slang-devel gettext-devel tar
