title: Help Translate NeoMutt
---

Do you speak a language other than English? Would you like to help other
speakers of that language?

As we added new features to NeoMutt, our translation files have become
out-of-date.

- [https://www.neomutt.org/translate](https://www.neomutt.org/translate)

The translations are broken down into simple sentences or phrases. They are
categorised as:

- Complete: A correct translation exists
- Fuzzy: The translation needs checking (but probably correct)
- Incomplete: No translation exists

You **do not** need any coding skills to help with the translations.

If you are interested, contact:

Thanks :-)
