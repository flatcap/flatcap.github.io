# Feature Release

## New Motto

### NeoMutt - "Teaching an Old Dog New Tricks"

It's very appropriate, it's catchy, it's funny. Thank you
[Alok Singh](https://github.com/Alok) for the suggestion.

## Important Changes

### Sidebar

The Sidebar has been accepted into Mutt and has undergone some changes in the
process. The default `sidebar_format` has changed to display only 'N' for new
mail. If you want the old behaviour, please set this config:

```
set sidebar_format = "%B%?F? [%F]?%* %?N?%N/?%S"
set mail_check_stats = yes
```

Also note that `$sidebar_refresh` has been dropped. It is no longer needed and
it was misleading when it was.

## New Features

- [**New Mail Command**]({{site.url}}/feature/new-mail) - Execute a command on
  receipt of new mail
- [**vim-keys**][vim-keys] - Mutt config for vim users
- [**LMDB**]({{site.url}}/feature/lmdb) - In-memory header caching database
