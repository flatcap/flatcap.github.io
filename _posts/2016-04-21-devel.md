title: Devel -- Right-Hand-Sidebar

Kevin McCarthy's been busy reworking how Mutt draws windows. This is
a stepping stone to a more layout-versatile Mutt.

I've ported the Sidebar to his work, simplifying the code in the process.

[now integrated]

For fun, I added a `$sidebar_on_right` variable to test the code.
