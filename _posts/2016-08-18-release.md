# Developer Release

This is the first release of NeoMutt based on the upstream Mutt 1.7.0.

It compiles, it runs, it *looks* OK, but don't use it on any email that you
value.

If you find a bug, please
[raise an issue](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues), or
[notify the devel mailing list](http://mailman.neomutt.org/mailman/listinfo/neomutt-devel-neomutt.org).

If no significant problems are found, this version will be released next week.
