## Release for Mutt-1.6.1

Many thanks to new NeoMutt contributors: Yoshiki VÃ¡zquez Baeza and Santiago
Torres.

This release sees many bug-fixes in Mutt, some more NeoMutt bug fixes and
a couple of improvements to the Sidebar.

Thank you to all the people who reported problems.

### Fixes and Improvements

- Build for Notmuch works if Sidebar is disabled
- Sidebar functions work even if the Sidebar is hidden
- sidebar-next-new, etc, only find **new** mail, as documented
- Notmuch supports **very** long queries

### Under Development

Yoshiki and Santiago are working on a 'new-mail' command which is executed when
new mail arrives. It should be ready, soon.

These patches apply to Mutt-1.6.1
