# Mailing lists for Users and Developers

Announcing the arrival of the NeoMutt mailing lists.

## NeoMutt Users

This list is ideal for new users of NeoMutt and people wanting to learn more.

All non-technical NeoMutt discussions are welcome here.

- What's your favourite feature?
- Do you have a killer config file?
- Have you found a bug?
- Do you want some help?

When asking for help, please remember that we're volunteers. (oh and check
Google first :-)

## NeoMutt Developers

This is a technical list, used for discussing the code, build and documentation

to get early warning of new bugs.

- Bugs
- Features
- Code
- Distros
- Enhancements
- Git

- Send emails in plain text, not HTML
- Use an informative subject line
- Keep attachments small, or better still: link to the files
- Remember that we're volunteers and we may take a while to reply
