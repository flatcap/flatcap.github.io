Just a quick note to say "**Happy New Year!**" to everyone.

Development's been a bit slow over the festive period, but it didn't stop.
There will be a new release soon.

In other news, [NeoMutt](https://github.com/neomutt)'s up to
[342 GitHub stars](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/stargazers). That means
it has overtaken the **mutt-kz** repository. For a long time, when Mutt was
stagnating, [Karel Zak](https://github.com/karelzak)'s repo kept the idea of
development alive. Thanks, Karel.

If you haven't already,
[**please star NeoMutt**](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/stargazers), to
show your appreciation.

Thanks.
