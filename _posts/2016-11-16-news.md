# Three Hundred Stars on GitHub

Thank you everyone! Eight months and we're going from strength to strength.

**GitHub users**:
[Please show your support with a star](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt)

## What have we Achieved?

So far, we've added 29 features, and have more in development. Also there are
3 contrib features. On top of this we've done lots of testing, fixed lots of
bugs and created a mountain of documentation.

Perhaps our greatest achievement, though, is getting features accepted into
upstream Mutt (Sidebar, Compressed Folders, Trash Folder, XDG Config).

Many thanks to everyone who's been helping to make NeoMutt a success.

Long may it continue!
