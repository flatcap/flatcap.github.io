New releases of NeoMutt will be signed with my GPG key:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Richard Russon (NeoMutt) \<rich@flatcap.org\>**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fingerprint: 86C2&nbsp;3972&nbsp;70DD&nbsp;7A56&nbsp;1263&nbsp;CA4E&nbsp;5FAF&nbsp;0A6E&nbsp;**E737&nbsp;1805**

This guarantees that any bugs you find are **my** fault :-)

## Getting My Key

You can retrieve my key from a public keyserver, using the command:

    gpg2 --recv-keys E7371805

Unless you meet me, in person, and verify my identity, you should not **trust**
this key. If you're planning a keysigning party anywhere near Oxford, England,
let me know.

## Checking Downloads

If you download the source, or patches, you can now verify them.
First, check the signature on the CHECKSUM file:

    gpg2 --verify neomutt-20160404-CHECKSUM.txt

You will see something like:

    gpg: Signature made Fri 08 Apr 2016 16:51:31 BST using RSA key ID E7371805
    gpg: Good signature from "Richard Russon (NeoMutt) <rich@flatcap.org>" [unknown]
    gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
    gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
    Primary key fingerprint: 86C2 3972 70DD 7A56 1263  CA4E 5FAF 0A6E E737 1805

Next, check the downloads' checksums.

    sha256sum -c neomutt-20160404-CHECKSUM.txt

Hopefully, you will see something like:

    neomutt-20160404.tar.gz: OK
    neomutt-20160404.zip: OK
    neomutt-patches-20160404.tar.gz: OK

## Checking Git Tags

You can use git to download and verify the source. Below, we clone the source,
checking-out the "neomutt-20160404" branch. Then we verify that the tag is
signed.

    git clone -b neomutt-20160404 https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt.git
    cd neomutt
    git verify-tag neomutt-20160404

Again, you will see something like:

    gpg: Signature made Fri 08 Apr 2016 15:07:39 BST using RSA key ID E7371805
    gpg: Good signature from "Richard Russon (NeoMutt) <rich@flatcap.org>" [unknown]
    gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
    gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
    Primary key fingerprint: 86C2 3972 70DD 7A56 1263  CA4E 5FAF 0A6E E737 1805
