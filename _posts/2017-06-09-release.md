## Notes

This is a second bug-fix release It tidies up a few small problems from last
week's release (like the missing ChangeLog :-)

- **[@NeoMutt_Org](https://twitter.com/NeoMutt_Org)** - Follow us on
  **Twitter**!
- Six features are now "always built" as part of NeoMutt: sidebar, imap, pop,
  smtp, compressed, nntp. These features have no build dependencies and don't
  add much to the size.

## Key Bindings

<https://www.neomutt.org/guide/configuration#bind-warnings>

With the config, below, the 'g' mapping will not be usable.

```
bind index g  group-reply
bind index gg first-entry
```

This is a limitation of Mutt. NeoMutt now warns you if you overwrite key
bindings. To fix the warning, first disable the mapping:

```
bind index g  noop
bind index gg first-entry
```
