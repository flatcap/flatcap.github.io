**Notes**:

From the outside, this is a small release. Inside a **LOT** has changed.

The major new feature is the addition of Lua Scripting. So far, it's very
limited -- it can get/set variables -- but its inclusion make it easier of
other developers to experiment.

**Devel Notes**:

Behind the scenes, the code has had a month's worth of intensive care. There's
been widespread tidying of the source and removal of obsolete code. This was
rounded off by running `clang-format` on the entire source tree.
