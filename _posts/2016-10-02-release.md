## Important Note

The pager crashes should now be fixed.

A recent change to the pager (to allow index updates) caused crashed for a lot
of people. Sorry about that. We've tried to make the pager as bulletproof as we
can.

More worryingly, the changes caused some unexpected behaviour in the gcc
compiler. gcc decided some of the checks weren't necessary. This option has
been disabled and more investigation is planned.

## Thanks
